# About me

My name is Qingdou(Paulina) Han, a first year M.S. student in biostatistics department , the Mailman School of Public Health in [Columbia University in the city of New York](https://www.columbia.edu/). And I completed my bachelor degree in statistics in [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/).

I took courses in Biostatistical Method, Probability, Mathematical Statistics, Statistical Learning, Data Science, Mathematical Modelling, Applied Time-Series, Linear Model, Stochastic Process and Statistical Computing.

I'm interested in analyzing high-dimensional data. My research mainly involves doing variable selection, dimension reduction through penalized regression and statistical learning methods.
